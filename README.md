# workshop-unit-testing

This project demonstrates how to perform unit testing on a JavaScript project using Mocha and Chai for testing, Rewire for module mocking, and NYC for code coverage.

Install required dependecies

`yarn`

### Writing Tests

1. Write your unit tests in the `test` directory. Follow the naming convention `<module-name>.test.js`.

2. Use Mocha and Chai for writing test cases. You can create test suites with `describe` and write test cases with `it`.

3. Utilize Rewire to mock and override module dependencies for isolated unit testing.
